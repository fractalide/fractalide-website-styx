        <h2 class="sub_heading_blue">A gift to you from Fractalide</h2>

        <p>
            There's a high probability you were recently gifted a card from a mad balding bearded man.
        </p>
        <p>
            He saw something in you.
        </p>
        <p>
            There <i>might</i> have been the feint glimmer of you being a pioneer (no, not the idiotic Silly Valley sort of pioneer). You <i>could possibly</i> have a spine that can shoulder responsibility. <i>Maybe</i> even capable of speaking truth to power. Surely not the last two together and almost certainly not all three together.

            Though, in the infinitesimally small chance you are such a person that possess all three qualities, you think it'll be impossible to undergo a simple Copernican shift on how you view data and addresses.
            Which means you won't see the importance of building a browser for an information centric network ... from scratch. Nor will you be able to populate this new internet with new applications. Indeed you'll probably be sucking from the teat of Google, Facebook and Twitter.

            You're handing your identity to these tech giants and not able to experience the degree of self sovereignty available to you.

            If you're not your average sausage out of the sausage factory then you need some filthy lucre, which serves as an invitation for you to participate in the early stages of a new internet. To start off you're going to need to email the below information to the email address on your card. <mark> 1.) ADA address generated from this <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli">software</a> 2.) The code that's on your card.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
            The amount on the card will be sent to the address you emailed us.
