  Fractalide started life in 2014 as a Master Thesis in Université Catholique de Louvain under Professor Peter Van Roy. Since then, the project has undergone multiple rewrites in different programming languages, with new functionality and realisations. Every contribution helps us complete this undertaking, so we thank you for your support.
