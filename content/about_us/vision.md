                        Currently it is unintuitive for non-technical end users to interact with published cryptocontracts. For this reason cryptocontracts will not easily reach mainstream.

                    <p>
                        End users expect a convenient one-click platform that delivers user friendly yet secure third party applications which are designed to use cryptocontracts. This platform can be broken down into three parts: building, distribution and the blockchain interaction parts.

                    <p>
                        The vision is to build a platform that makes the building and distribution of blockchain friendly applications laughably easy.
