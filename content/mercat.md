                    <p>
                        Hyperflow's software blocks are shareable on Fractalmarket, a marketplace that allows users to search for software blocks, and include them into their dapps, meaning a reduction in software development cost. It enables people to build ever more powerful dapps by standing on the shoulders of giants.
                        </p>
                        <p>Fractalmarket integrates into Hyperflow. Anyone can upload and trade software blocks using ADA, or publish them as open source with or without a price tag.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trading of open source software is a fundamental shift away from the centralised, advertisment-pushing revenue models of yore, moving to decentralised, community-based funding.
