        <h2 class="sub_heading_blue">A gift to you from Fractalide</h2>
        <p>
            There's a high probability you were recently gifted a card from a mad balding bearded man.
        </p>
        <p>
            He saw something in you.
        </p>
        <p>
            There <i>might</i> have been the feint glimmer of you being a pioneer (no, not the idiotic Silly Valley sort of pioneer). You <i>could possibly</i> have a spine that can shoulder responsibility. <i>Maybe</i> even capable of speaking truth to power. Surely not the last two together and almost certainly not all three together.

            This means you won't become filthy rich, because you're handing your identity to these tech Giants and not able to grasp the degree of self sovereignty you can exercise.

            If you're not your average sausage out of the sausage factory then you need some filthy lucre, which serves as an invitation for you to participate in the early stages of a new internet. To start off you're going to need to email the below information to the email address on your card. <mark> 1.) ADA address generated from this <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli">software</a> 2.) The code that's on your card.</mark>
