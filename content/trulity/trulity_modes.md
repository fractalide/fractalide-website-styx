                    <p>
                        Nodemoders are the first wave of pioneers. These people move into uninhabited, wild territory seeking out and extracting gold ore and nuggets from the hills and rivers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This browser mode consists of a text editor and an interpreter so that people may build the very lowest level of reusable, reproducible and composable components. Luceo is the gold to be extracted. A large portion of Luceo will be used to subsidise nodemoders building out initial infrastructure.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="sub_heading_blue">Graph mode</h2>
                    <p>
                        Graphmoders are the second wave of pioneers consisting of blacksmiths, inn keepers, bakers, coin minters etc. They are the specialists that sell services in new towns earning recently minted gold coins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This browser mode consists of a visual tool for domain experts to compose components created by nodemoders into problem solving dapps. Graphmoders might not be programmers, but they do know how to snap lego blocks together and to markup their compositions allowing them to earn Luceo.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="hyperflow_mode hyperflow_item_3">
                    <h2 class="sub_heading_blue">Run mode</h2>
                    <p>
                        Runmoders are the last phase of settlers, they seek out already built towns with polished products and a high standard of living. The town must have sufficient gold circulating so that they may comfortably set up a business, albeit, in a competitive environment and thrive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This browser mode, allows one to buy and run dapps in much the same way one interacts with websites in legacy browsers, except they have the power of Google's entire data dissemination capabilities in their back pocket.
