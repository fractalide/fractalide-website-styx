                        Being truthful and responsible are the core characteristics of a hero. Speaking truth to power and shouldering responsibility to the point of buckling knees is the only antidote to bitterness and resentment.

                    <p>
                        The words truth & responsibility, typically depicted by a hero's sword, are combined to name the browser <i>trulity</i>. Two qualities a pioneer needs to overcome the chaos dragons guarding and obscuring a new internet frontier. A frontier where freedom of speech prevails and monopolies can't disable your account or spy on you. These ideological virtue signalling dragons who think their role is to police free speech are real and won't hesitate to take your head off.

                        Trulity consists of two systems: <mark>1) A cryptocurrency allowing you, at negligible cost, to have a bank in your back pocket. 2) An Information Centric Network (<a class="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-centric_networking">ICN</a>) allowing you, at negligible cost, to have the data dissemination capabilities of internet monopolies from your back pocket.</mark> Participating in the above <a class="" href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html"> socially scalable systems</a> equates to pulling a kingmaker sword from its hard stone sheath.

                    <p>
                        Trulity is capable of slashing open the bellies of centralised TCP/IP monopolies, releasing billions of pent up dollars into the market.
