                        Ouroboros, Cardanoâ€™s Proof of Stake algorithm, requires users to be online, which isn't always possible for everyone. Ouroboros allows offline users to delegate their vote to a stake pool of their choice. This way, users can take part in securing the consensus algorithm and earn rewards.

                        The Cardano Shelley is due for release around Q3 2018, and shifts the architecture to a completely decentralised Cardano. Fractalide's Cardano Stake Pool will then go live.

                    Centralised mining is an issue for currencies like Bitcoin, because when pools get too big, it can lead to an attack on the consensus protocol. Being on Cardano, Fractalide's stake pool participates in a process that avoids centralisation.

                    Cryptocurrency users take part in mining and earn rewards. Cardano allows you to nominate another party, like Fractalide, to vote on your behalf to make it easier. If you nominate someone else, both you and your nominee will be rewarded through the Cardano blockchain, which removes the fear of theft.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you nominate Fractlide to vote for you, all earnings, after server costs, go into Fractalide development. By nominating Fractalide, you're helping improve Fractalide and the Cardano ecosystem.
