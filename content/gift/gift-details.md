        <h2 class="sub_heading_blue">A gift to you from fractalide</h2>
        <p>
            A mad balding bearded man recently gifted you a card.
        </p>
        <p>
            He saw potential in you.
        </p>
        <p>
            There <i>might</i> have been the feint glimmer of a pioneer in you. <i>Possibly</i> the glimmer is you able to shoulder responsibility till your knees quake? <i>Maybe</i> you are able to speak truth to power?
        </p>
        <p>
            In the infinitesimally small chance you are such a person, you have arrived at a place where your courage and skills can bring about a historic change in society. Few programmers rise to the occasion as most prefer the comforts of the host centric matrix as they suck at the teat of Google, Facebook and other tech giants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your mission, should you wish to accept it, is to mobilise your skillset and assist in building a new information centric internet (ICN) and <a href="/trulity">Trulity</a> an ICN browser. For too long have we suffered at the hands of tech giants who build browsers for point-to-point or host centric networks that fortify their positions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Doing an information dissemination over a point-to-point communication system results, as a natural emergent effect, in the creation of information monopolies. Why? We do not address data by name directly and instead go through middlemen, the host, to access information they indexed. When information monopolies knock on the door, shortly after the big brother of surveillance capitalism follows.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Copernican shift is required before we see an end to free speech and self sovereignty. The center of this solar system is the sun (data), not the earth (host). We must address data by name, thereby bringing about an onset of information centric networking, or named data networking. Just as the use of the TCP/IP protocol expanded massively after the onset of the HTTP browser, so, with your help, an information centric network will come to prominence by building a browser for an information centric network.
        </p>

            If you wish to decline this mission, please seek out an acceptable candidate and hand your card to them.

            If on the other hand, you're not your average sausage out of the sausage factory then you need some filthy lucre, which serves as an invitation for you to participate in the early stages of a new internet. To start off you're going to need to email the below information to the email address on your card. <mark> 1.) The <b>code</b> that's on your card as the <b>email subject title</b>. 2.) <b>ADA address</b> generated from this <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-cli">software</a> in the <b>email body</b> (only use this software to generate the address and <b>don't use</b> an existing ADA address, which might be in a scenario where you cannot access your private key, i.e. hardware wallet, or on an exchange)</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't have time to setup the ADA client to generate your address, please send an email with the code as the subject and you will be contacted at a later date for the address.
        </p>
        <p>
            The amount of <a href="/luceo">Luceo</a> on the card will be sent to the address you emailed us. We still have a couple of months to go before the release of mainnet in Q3 2019, so be patient and start slinging parentheses.
        </p>
        <p>
            All our code is MPLv2 license, you own your own code as we use the <a href="https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:1/C4/">C4</a> as our development contract.

            Here be dragons, the free speech tech giant police will take your head off, tread carefully.
