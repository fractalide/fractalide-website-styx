        <h2 class="sub_heading_blue">A gift to you from fractalide</h2>
        <p>
            A mad, bald, bearded man recently gave you something - a card. Because he saw hidden potential in you.
        </p>
        <p>
            He <i>might</i> have seen the feint glimmer of a pioneer in you. He <i>possibly</i> thought he saw the ability to shoulder responsibility till your knees quake?  He thought <i>maybe</i> you have the gift of being able to speak truth to power?
        </p>
        <p>
            If <i>you</i> are such a person, you have arrived at a place and time where <i>your</i> courage and skills may bring about a historic change in society. Few will <i>rise</i> to this occasion as most prefer the comforts of the host-centric matrix. While <i>sucking</i> at the teat of Google, Facebook and the other tech giants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your <i>mission</i> is to mobilize your mind, body and spirit to help building something new. A <i>new</i> information-centric internet andÂ <a href="/trulity">Trulity</a>, its first information-centric browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            For too <i>long</i> have we suffered at the hands of oligarchs. Who build browsers <i>broken</i> by design and intended to fortify their positions.
        </p>
