                      Hyperflow draws much inspiration from the 1980ies HyperCard application. It allows non-technical people to build and run problem solving apps. Though we will differ from HyperCard on these points.

                    The intuitive, and easy to learn approach HyperCard is famous for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Itâ€™s very easy to try out your app, by switching between run mode and design mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep the concept of <strong>cards</strong> and <strong>stacks</strong>, an analogy would be; a card is a webpage and a stack is a website. Each card contains GUI components and logic that links other cards together to form a stack of cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cards, stacks and low level components are shareable via Fractalmarket.

                <p>
                    Remove the HyperTalk programming language and replace it with Flowscript. A Flow-based Programming language that promotes reusability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HyperCard didn't have a network layer. We'll add networking to share apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  HyperCard is old and outdated. Hyperflow is a fresh new take on HyperCard, being completely rewritten from scratch.
