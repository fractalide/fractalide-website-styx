                      The most distinctive feature of Hyperflow is that it can be used by everyone, regardless of technical know-how. From advanced programmers to regular users with no programming skills.

                        The current trend is to use a centralised webserver which interacts with a decentralised blockchain. This approach is a cop out and introduces a trusted third party susceptible to attack.

                    <p>
                        To develop a properly decentralised app framework we need to start at a more fundamental level. We do this by making use of Named Data Networking, which divorces location from data. Meaning in order to get data you do not need to go to an IP address. You simply issue a request for data by name and the network, a TCP/IP overlay, will return it.

                    <p>
                        The second fundamental modification we've made is breaking the application into atomic reusable and reproducible units making them conducive to being transmitted over a Named Data Network.

                        Hyperflow is dapp browser which allows you to build, test, run and distribute your dapps to other people. Dapps run locally on your computer and communicate with other dapps using Named Data Networking.
