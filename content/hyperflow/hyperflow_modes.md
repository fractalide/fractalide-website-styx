                    <p>
                        Node mode is for programmers. It allows them to build reusable, reproducible and composable software agents, or nodes. These are “black box” processes that do one and only one thing. They have unique names, enforced by the nix language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Racket is the glue language. It provides the programmer with plenty of <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/search/index.html?q=H%3A">languages</a> to use within agents, and the Rust language makes for fast, secure dapps.

                    <p>
                        Graph mode is for people who are experts in their industries, such as engineers, biologists, or mathematicians, who may not necessarily have programming skills. Using a visual tool, they can easily compose subgraphs using the agents created by programmers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subgraphs and agents are both nodes, and can be composed into networks of nodes, also known as graphs, which become a dapp. Nodes are independent entities, and thanks to Fractalide, they are reusable, reproducable and composable. Nodes can be connected in as many ways as you wish, to create any number of different dapps.

                    <p>
                        Run mode is for everyone, and does not require programming knowledge. It runs dapps created by programmers and industry experts. Just enter the name of the dapp in the search bar, and Hyperflow will find and run the dapp, just like any other browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this mode, you can buy high-quality dapps. A typical dapp on Hyperflow would be a cryptocurrency wallet. In the future, dapps will be able to talk to smart contracts to carry out advanced concepts, such as taking out insurance.
