            <h3>Built using reusable, reproducible and composable software components</h3>
            <p>
                This design pattern allow people to easily reuse the software components to build new wallets to support other cryptocurrencies. The more the code is used the more it becomes robust. Which results in safer more secure code.

            <h3>Adheres to the formal <br>specification of a Cardano Wallet</h3>
            <p>
                Cantor adheres to the <a href="#">Cardano Wallet Formal Specification</a> document. This allows for a better implementation that accurately maps reality. This reduces architectural problems. Upgrading Cardano becomes smoother and more predictable.

            <h3>Designed for long-term integration <br>with Fractalide DApps</h3>
            <p>
                Hyperflow is designed to be a browser for descentralized applications. Other dapps will most likely need to intereact with Cardano's currency ADA. All those dapps need to do is call in Cantor and the functionality becomes available to that dapp.
