            <p>
                Cantor is a Cardano Wallet and is Fractalide's first application. The wallet allows you to send and receive ADA transactions. Please consider this alpha software - not to be used in anger.

            <h3>Built using reusable, reproducible and composable software components</h3>
            <p>
                This design pattern allow people to easily reuse components to build new wallets to support other cryptocurrencies. Each component is a well specified module that composes. A composition of well specified components used to implement a top level specification helps reduce the semantic gap considerably.

            <h3>Adheres to the formal <br>specification of a Cardano Wallet</h3>
            <p>
                Cantor adheres to the <a href="https://cardanodocs.com/technical/formal-specification-for-a-cardano-wallet/">Cardano Wallet Formal Specification</a> document. This allows for a better implementation that accurately maps a reality which has been formally verified. Thereby reducing architectural problems and improving upgrades. We become better citizens in the Cardano community.

            <h3>Designed for long-term integration <br>with Fractalide DApps</h3>
            <p>
                Hyperflow is designed to be a browser for decentralized applications. Other dapps will most likely need to interact with Cardano's currency ADA. All dapps need to do is call in Cantor and transactional functionality becomes available. Essentially Cantor plays well with dapps, increasing the probability it'll be used more often.
