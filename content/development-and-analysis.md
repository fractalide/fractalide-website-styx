                <p>
                    Fractalide applications are written using reusable, reproducible and composable software blocks.
                    This means reduced software development costs and increased quality and stability.

                <h3>Reusable</h3>
                <p>
                    Components consist of a function with predefined bounded buffer inputs and outputs. Every component has a single function with the same signature, which allows for a reusable system. As components are reused, the quality of the software improves. Over time, the components become increasingly robust, meaning you can spend less time fighting fires.

                <h3>Reproducible</h3>
                <p>
                    Most reusable systems don’t consider reproducibility - the ability to reproduce a system with the least work possible. We've reduced it to typing a component’s name. The system sets up all transitive dependencies, even if they have dependencies on other subsystems like Python.

                <h3>Composable</h3>
                <p>
                    Composable systems allow the programmer to layer software into abstractions. Each abstraction does one and only one thing. We make it easy to decompose an abstraction and isolate the exact component you want, then reuse it in a new abstraction. Strong isolation lets programmers hunt for bugs more quickly, and design systems that are more efficient when it comes to long-term maintenance.

                <p>
                    Fractalide apps run on Hyperflow and are reusable, reproducible and composable components that can talk to smart contracts on the blockchain. We offer services to help design and develop applications, from general purpose applications which might not connect to a blockchain, to logistics applications coupled to specific blockchains.
