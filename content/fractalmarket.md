                    <p>
                        Hyperflow's components, cards and stacks are shareable. Think about a card as a web page and a stack as a website.                         Fractalmarket allows users to search for components, then include them into their applications. This allows for a reduction in software development cost. It enables people to build ever more powerful apps by standing on the shoulders of giants.
                        </p>
                        <p>Fractalmarket integrates into Hyperflow. Users can upload and trade components, cards and stacks using ADA, or publish them as open source with or without a price tag.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trading of open source software aims to solve the problem of community funding.
