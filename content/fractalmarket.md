                    <p>
                        Fractalmarket allows users to search for components, then include them into their decentralised applications. This allows for a reduction in software development cost. It enables people to build ever more powerful dapps by standing on the shoulders of giants.
                        </p>
                        <p>Fractalmarket integrates into Hyperflow. Users can upload, buy, sell or publish components as open source with or without a price tag. Publishers may choose to purchase a timeout DRM license. Which defaults to an open source license should it not be extended.
