            <p>
                Proof of Stake consensus algorithms require users to be online when it's their turn to make a block, this isn't always possible. A stakepool allows users to delegate their vote to a stake pool of their choice. This way, users can take part in securing the consensus algorithm, earn rewards and be offline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cardano's Shelley release is due around Q2 2019, it starts the architecture shift to a completely decentralised mode. Fractalide's ADA Stakepool will then go live.
            </p>
            <p>
                We return 85% the rewards to our delegators in the same epoch they are released. All our pool software is <a href="https://github.com/fractalide/fractalpools">open source</a> and we operate is a high security environment. Pool earnings are used to help fund the development of an open source browser for a future internet. Just as cryptocurrencies allow for a bank in your back pocket, so Fractalide aims to give you data dissemination capabilities of Internet monopolies at negligible cost.

        <p class="stake_pool_text">
            Centralised mining is an issue for currencies like Bitcoin, because when pools get too big and centralised, it can lead to an attack on the consensus protocol. Fractalide's stake pool participates in a process that avoids centralisation.

            Proof-of-Stake users take part in staking and earn rewards. Cardano allows you to be offline and nominate another party, like Fractalide, to stake on your behalf. If you nominate someone else, both you and your nominee will be rewarded through the Cardano blockchain, which removes the fear of theft.

            If you appreciate Fractalide and want your experience improved, then nominate us to stake for you. All pool earnings (not nominator earnings), after server costs, goes into development of <a href="/trulity">Trulity</a>, a censorship free browser. By nominating Fractalide, you help promote tools that further free speech.
