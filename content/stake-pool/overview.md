        <p>
            Fractalide prefers reaching out to blockchain communities by providing useful services that prompt word-of-mouth instead of shallow digital marketing. This is our way of onboarding users onto our free and open source browser. We hope our stakepools introduce you to the Fractalide browser and encourage you to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            All our stakepool software is <a class="" href="https://github.com/fractalide/fractalpools">free and open source</a>. We encourage you to use and contribute to the source code. We've endeavoured to make the entire solution simple and turnkey.

        <h3>Cardano (ADA)</h3>
        <p>
            Cardano (ADA) stakepool will come online in 2019 when the Shelley release takes place. We aim to be one of the first Cardano (ADA) stakepools on the block.

        <h3>Luceo (CEO)</h3>
        <p>
            Luceo (CEO) is an implementation of the Ouroboros consensus protocol and is a new genesis block. The <a class="" href="/luceo/">Luceo</a> coin will be used on the <a class="" href="/mercat/">Mercat Cross</a> and be the main currency in the <a class="" href="/trulity/">Trulity</a> browser. Luceo stakepools will come online once we've completed an ICO and go live in Q3 2019.

        <h3>Tezos (XTZ)</h3>
        <p>
            Initially our primary reason for supporting a Tezos (XTZ) stakepool was to gain experience running stakepools before Cardano (ADA) came online. We've found the XTZ community to be friendly and full of beans and thus, have decided to keep the XTZ Stakepool a permanent fixture.
