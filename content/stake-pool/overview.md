        <p>
            Proof of Stake consensus algorithms require users to be online when it's their turn to make a block, this isn't always possible. A stakepool allows users to delegate their vote to a stake pool of their choice. This way, users can take part in securing the consensus algorithm, earn rewards and be offline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fractalide focuses on Ouroboros technologies. Ada and Luceo solve different problems and co-exist harmoniously. Both will have the features of sharding and Proof-of-stake as they share the same code base. Where they differ; Ada is configured as a non-privacy preserving currency, while Luceo a privacy preserving currency.
