                    Tech giants and governments seek to police free speech. They will deplatform you and in the near future, should they control the monetary supply, render you broke at the flick of a switch. Some countries have already implemented such systems such as the Social Credit Score.

                <p>
                    An immutable transaction history is critical for public trust in Luceo. It's unacceptable to have a privileged group of people undo their transactions. As is the case after the Ethereum DAO hack which resulted in the loss of 70 million USD.

                <h3>Permissionless</h3>
                <p>
                    Anyone can participate in securing, spending and building with Luceo. There is no up front fee to run a Luceo stakepool, quite unlike some chains with a fee of 10 million USD. Anyone can run a node, access a wallet and make transactions on the Luceo distributed ledger.

                    Luceo enables an economic model for the peer-to-peer communication protocol Copernica. The existing internet runs on a pervasive advertising push economic model. What does the Copernica economic model look like when all data is signed and optionally encrypted on a pull network?
