                        The fundamental reason for relying on tech giants is because we are doing a data dissemination over a host-centric communication system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obtaining data in a host-centric communication system means users must go through a host indirection, a data gatekeeper. Where there are gatekeepers you get rent-seekers. It is therefore expected data dissemination monopolies arise as an emergent phenomenon.                    </p>
