                    <p>
                        Hyperflow components, cards and stacks are shareable. An analogy would be; a card is a web page and a stack is a website. You do this by uploading components to Fractalmarket, which integrates into Hyperflow. Users may buy and sell components, cards and stacks using ADA, or publish as open source with or without a price tag.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fractalmarket allows users to search for components, then include the components into applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fractalmarket rewards people for creating and using reusable components, cards and stacks. This allows for a reduction in software development cost. It enables people to build ever powerful apps by standing on the shoulders of giants.

                        The trading open source software aims to solve the problem of community funding.
