                         Hyperflow is a browser of smart contracts apps. It draws much inspiration from HyperCard, by allowing non-technical people to easily build and run problem solving apps. Though we will differ from HyperCard on these points.

                <p>
                    The intuitive, and easy to learn approach HyperCard is famous for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Itâ€™s very easy to try out your newly built app, by simply switching between run mode and design mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep the concept of <strong>cards</strong> and <strong>stacks</strong>, an analogy would be; a card is a webpage and a stack is a website. Each card contains GUI components and logic that links other cards together to form a stack of cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cards, stacks and low level components are shareable via Fractalmarket.

                <h2 class="sub_heading_blue">Hypercard concepts to remove</h2>
                <p>
                    Remove the HyperTalk programming language and replace it with Flowscript, a Flow-based Programming language that promotes reusability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HyperCard didn't have a network layer, it should go without saying, but this will be corrected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HyperCard is old and outdated. Hyperflow will be a fresh new take on HyperCard, being completely rewritten from scratch.
