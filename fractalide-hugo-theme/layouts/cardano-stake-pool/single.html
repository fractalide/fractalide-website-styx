                        Ouroboros, Cardanoâ€™s Proof of Stake algorithm, needs users to be online. Which is inconvenient for many users. Ouroboros allows offline users to delegate their vote to a stake pool of their choice. This way, users may take part in securing the consensus algorithm and earn rewards.

                        Q2 or Q3, 2018 signals the Cardano Shelley release. Shelley represents a completely decentralized Cardano. That's when Fractalide's Cardano Stake Pool goes live.

                    Game theory motivates stake pools not to get too big allowing an attack on the consensus protocol. So we avoid the problem of Bitcoin's centralized mining.

                    Users take part in securing the consensus algorithm and earn rewards. The Cardano blockchain pays the delegators and delegatees, removing fear of theft.

                    All stake pool earnings, after server costs, goes to Fractalide development. We welcome your vote delegation. Your help improves Fractalide and surrounding Cardano software.
