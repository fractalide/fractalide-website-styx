                        <p>
                          Fractalide applications are written using reusable, reproducible and composable software blocks that allow for a reduction in software development costs. Customers will see the benefit of developing software this way through a reduction in cost and increase in software quality and stability.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="sub_heading_blue">Reusability</h4>
                        <p>
                          Every component consists of a function with predefined inputs and outputs that are bounded buffers and not function parameters, meaning that every component has exactly the same function signature. This setup allows for a very reusable system. Similar systems are the command line utilities of unix systems which use stdin, stdout and stderr for IO. Command line utilities are well known for be reusable. Software quality is also improved because the more programmers using a component the more bugs that can be found and fixed. A fix in one component used by a many users means that fix goes out to every user. Over time components become more bullet proof and robust meaning programmers don’t have to be constantly firefighting.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="sub_heading_blue">Reproducibility</h4>
                        <p>
                          Most reusable systems don’t pay enough attention to reproducibility. Reproducibility is the act of reproducing a system with the minimum amount of  manual steps possible. In our case we have reduced it down to typing the component’s name. The build system is intelligent enough to setup all the transitive dependencies of that component even if they have dependencies on other subsystems like python. Fewer manual steps means less money spent on programmer time, making programmers more efficient.
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="sub_heading_blue">Composability</h4>
                        <p>
                          Composable systems allows the programmer to easily layer software into abstractions. Each abstraction does one and only one thing. It’s quite easy to decompose an abstraction and isolate the exact component you want and reuse it in a new abstraction. Strong isolation allows the programmer to easily find bugs and design systems that are amenable to long term maintenance. The maintenance phase of software development is the most costly phase.

                          We use Fractalide to build financial systems and blockchains for government entities and corporations. The focus is on reusing as much as possible but custom solutions are accepted as it’ll expand our tool box and potentially bugs will be fixed by other users.

                          Fractalide Applications run in Hyperflow and are designed from reusable, reproducible and composable components that could be programmed to talk to smart contracts on the blockchain. We offer corporations development services to help design and develop their applications. These might just be general purpose applications which might not be connected to a blockchain or a logistics application tightly coupled to a specific blockchain.

                          Our language security specialist Meredith L. Patterson, the founder of the IEEE field Language-theoretic Security, will do a technical analysis of your white paper. Analysis also extend into doing a language security analysis of your contract programming language and blockchain implementation.
