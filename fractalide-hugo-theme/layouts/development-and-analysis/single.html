                        <p>
                          Fractalide applications reusable, reproducible and composable software blocks. That allows for a reduction in software development costs. Customers enjoy reduced cost and increase in software quality and stability.

                        <h3 class="sub_heading_blue">Reusability</h3>
                        <p>
                          Components consist of a function with predefined bounded buffer inputs and outputs. Every component has a single run function with the same signature. This setup allows for a very reusable system. Software quality improves because components are reusable. Over time components become robust, meaning programmers don’t have to firefight.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="sub_heading_blue">Reproducibility</h3>
                        <p>
                          Most reusable systems don’t pay enough attention to reproducibility. Reproducibility is the act of reproducing a system with the least amount of manual steps. In our case, we have reduced it down to typing the component’s name. The build system is can setup all transitive dependencies of that named component. Even if they have dependencies on other subsystems like python. Fewer manual steps mean less money spent on programmer time. Making programmers more efficient.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="sub_heading_blue">Composability</h3>
                        <p>
                          Composable systems allow the programmer to layer software into abstractions. Each abstraction does one and only one thing. It’s quite easy to decompose an abstraction and isolate the exact component you want. Then reuse it in a new abstraction. Strong isolation allows the programmer to find bugs and design systems. That is amenable to long-term maintenance. The maintenance phase of software development is the most costly phase.

                          We build financial systems and blockchains for government entities and corporations. We focus on reusing as much as possible. This helps us provide better prices to customers. We accept custom projects as they’ll expand our tool box. We also can incorporate existing blockchains.

                          Fractalide apps run on Hyperflow and are reusable, reproducible and composable components. They can talk to smart contracts on the blockchain.

                          We offer corporations development services to help design and develop their applications. These might be general purpose applications which might not connect to a blockchain. They may be logistics application coupled to a specific blockchain.
