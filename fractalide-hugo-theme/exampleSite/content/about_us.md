# About us

Fractalide started life as a Master Thesis in Universit√© catholique de Louvain under
Professor Peter Van Roy back in 2014. Since then the project has undergone
multiple rewrites in different programming languages, with new functionality and
realizations. Every contribution helps us complete this undertaking. Thank you.
