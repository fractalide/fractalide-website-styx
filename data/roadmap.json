        "description": "At this stage of the project, Luceo will only implement the Genesis Praos consensus protocol. It'll be a fully decentralised network capable of transactions. A testnet will allow users to try out the currency. Companies and individuals may setup stakepools and encourage users to delegate their Luceo to them.",

Fundamental to this is the implementation of the Named Data Networking (NDN) protocol in Rust. A front end for the NDN is needed as well as a frontend for Luceo users to make transactions. Lastly, a \"killer app\" is needed: Leveraging NDN to reduce the cost of data dissemination allows users to stream data without needing centralised tech giant monopolies like Youtube. This creates a use case for Luceo as users may charge for video streams.",
