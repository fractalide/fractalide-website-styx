                    <p>
                        We need a simple way to interact with a named data network. Trulity is a next generation browser built from scratch and is used to run named dapps.

                         Dapps need to be shared. Trulity connects to a dapp market called Fractalmarket, where anyone can buy, sell and share Trulity dapps.

                    <p>
                        Luceo is a cryptocurrency that implements the Ouroboros consensus protocol. Wherever you have browsers you have people interacting with each other. Where you have people interacting you'll have commerce. Better than interfacing with an antiquated banking infrastructure, Luceo is a modern cryptocurrency that completes the puzzle.
