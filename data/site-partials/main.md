                        We need a simple way to use smart contracts. Hyperflow is a browser for smart contract dapps and cryptocurrencies. It allows anyone to build and run dapps, such as cyrptocurrency wallets.

                    <p>
                        Once dapps are developed, there needs to be a place where they can be shared. Hyperflow connects to a dapp market called Fractalmarket, where anyone can buy, sell and share Hyperflow dapps.
